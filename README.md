# SmartCalc

## Implementation of usual calculator in C with GUI implementation based on QT libraries and modules.

- This program parses the input string of arithmetic expression in infix notation, converts it to postfix notation (reverse Polish notation) and performs calculations using Dijkstra's algorithm.

- The input string can contain the following arithmetic operations and mathematical functions: (a + b), a - b, a * b, a/b, a ^ b, a mod b, -a, +b, sqrt(x), ln (x), log(x), cos(x), sin(x), tan(x), acos(x), asin(x), atan(x).

- The program can calculate arbitrary arithmetic expressions in parentheses in infix notation by replacing the value of the variable x with a number, as well as plot a graph of the function specified by the expression in infix notation with the variable x.

You can enter up to 255 characters. The calculation will be performed after you enter the calculation expression and press `=`.
